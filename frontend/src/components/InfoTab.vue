      <h2>About The Display</h2>
    <p>
      This will be our 19th year with a computer controlled Christmas Lights Display.
      This year we have 34,123 RGB bulbs that are syncronized to music. Join us Christmas Eve
      as the neighboorhood counts down to see the Clock hit zero.
    </p>
    <p>Names you text to the display are checked against a database of common first names from the IRS. If your name isn't on that
        list, there may be a delay in it appearing.  Names are displayed below the clock soon after a text message is sent and are included 
        in the main display every 5-10 minutes depending on queue size. </p>
    <p>
